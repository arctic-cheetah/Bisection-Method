## BetweennessCentrality

```
BetweennessCentrality(graph)
```

> Computes the betweenness centrality of each vertex of a `graph`.

### Examples

```
>> BetweennessCentrality( Graph({agent1,agent2,agent3,agent4,agent5}, {agent1<->agent2,agent1<->agent3,agent2<->agent3,agent3<->agent4,agent3<->agent5})) 
{0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0}
        
>> BetweennessCentrality( Graph({1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5}, { 2->5, 3->6, 4->6, 1->5, 5->4, 6->1})) 
{5.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,5.0,7.0}
```
