## PerfectNumber

```
PerfectNumber(n)
```

> returns the `n`th perfect number. In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper 
positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. Currently `0 <= n <= 47` can be computed, otherwise the function returns unevaluated.
